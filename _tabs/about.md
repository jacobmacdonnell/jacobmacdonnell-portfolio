## Professional Summary

I’m a **GIAC-certified Incident Handler (GCIH, GSEC)** and Security Analyst with hands-on experience in **incident response, endpoint forensics, and threat hunting** through SANS SEC504 DFIR labs. I combine technical investigation skills with a background in Business Management and Psychology to communicate security findings clearly during high-pressure incidents.

I ranked in the **top 2% of the National Cyber League** team competition and focused on log analysis, network traffic investigation, and practical DFIR workflows. I’m currently completing the SANS Applied Cybersecurity Certificate (ACS) and pursuing GCFA (Expected May 2026).

## Projects

Check out my [cybersecurity projects](/categories) to see examples of my technical skills in action, including:

### National Cyber League (Spring 2025)
**Ranked Top 2% (63rd/4,798 Teams)**
- Specialized in **Network Traffic Analysis and Forensics**, identifying malicious C2 traffic and reconstructing attack timelines from PCAPs.
- Executed challenges in **OSINT**, **Web Exploitation**, and **Cryptography**.

### Enterprise Incident Response | SANS SEC504 (Falsimentis Simulation)
- **Investigation**: Executed the full IR lifecycle to neutralize a multi-stage wiper/ransomware breach. Analyzed memory dumps with **Volatility 3** to identify malicious process trees and injected code.
- **Network Forensics**: Reconstructed attack timelines by analyzing PCAPs and proxy logs to identify Command & Control (C2) channels and scope the extent of the breach.
- **Threat Hunting**: Detected low-jitter C2 beacons using **RITA & Zeek**. Performed high-speed log analysis with **Hayabusa** to track lateral movement and persistence mechanisms.

### Cloud & Web Exploitation | SANS SEC504 Lab Series
- **Cloud Security**: Identified exposed assets via **Masscan/TLS-Scan**. Exploited SSRF vulnerabilities to compromise AWS IAM credentials and audited configurations using **ScoutSuite**.
- **Offensive Operations**: Simulated adversary tradecraft including **AppLocker bypass** (Living off the Land), Command Injection, and browser hooking with **BeEF** to validate system hardening.
- **Credential Assessment**: Audited network authentication by capturing NTLM hashes with **Responder** (LLMNR poisoning) and validating password complexity policies using **Hashcat** and password spraying.
