## Project Overview

In this project, I developed a Python algorithm to automate the management of IP address access control for restricted content. The algorithm processes an allow list of IP addresses and removes specified IPs that should no longer have access, ensuring efficient and accurate updates to the access control system.

This automation significantly improves security by reducing manual errors and ensuring consistent updates to the IP allow list, which controls access to restricted content within the organization.

## Scenario

At my organization, access to restricted content is controlled with an allow list of IP addresses stored in the "allow_list.txt" file. The organization needed an automated solution to:

- Remove IP addresses that should no longer have access to restricted content
- Maintain an accurate and up-to-date allow list
- Reduce manual errors in IP list management
- Ensure consistent formatting of the allow list file

The goal was to create a Python algorithm that would efficiently process and update the allow list while maintaining data integrity and proper file handling.

## Implementation

### Algorithm Structure

The solution follows a structured approach with five key components working together to provide reliable IP access control management:

1. File Opening — Open and read the allow list file using proper file handling
2. Data Processing — Convert file contents into a manageable format
3. List Management — Process and remove specified IP addresses
4. Data Conversion — Prepare the updated list for file writing
5. File Update — Write the revised list back to the file

### Code Solution

My Python implementation demonstrates efficient file handling and list manipulation to maintain the IP allow list:

```python
# Assign the allow list file name
import_file = "allow_list.txt"

# Open and read the allow list file
with open(import_file, "r") as file:
    ip_addresses = file.read()

# Convert the string into a list
ip_addresses = ip_addresses.split()

# Iterate through the remove list
for element in remove_list:
    # Remove IP addresses that are on the remove list
    if element in ip_addresses:
        ip_addresses.remove(element)

# Convert the list back into a string
ip_addresses = "\n".join(ip_addresses)

# Update the file with the revised list
with open(import_file, "w") as file:
    file.write(ip_addresses)
```

### Code Explanation

Let's break down how the algorithm works:

1. **File Opening**: The algorithm uses a `with` statement to open the allow list file in read mode (`"r"`), ensuring proper resource management.
2. **Data Reading**: The `.read()` method converts the file contents into a string, which is then split into a list using `.split()` for easier manipulation.
3. **IP Removal**: A `for` loop iterates through the remove list, checking if each IP exists in the allow list before removing it.
4. **Data Conversion**: The `.join()` method combines the updated list back into a string with newline separators.
5. **File Update**: The file is opened in write mode (`"w"`) to overwrite its contents with the revised IP list.

## Technical Benefits

The Python algorithm provided several key benefits to the organization:

- **Efficient File Handling**: Uses `with` statements for proper resource management
- **Error Prevention**: Checks for IP existence before removal to avoid errors
- **Clean Data Format**: Maintains consistent formatting with newline separators
- **Automated Process**: Reduces manual intervention and potential errors
- **Resource Management**: Properly closes files after operations

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

This project showcased several important programming skills:

- **File Operations**: Proper file handling with `with` statements
- **String Manipulation**: Converting between strings and lists
- **List Processing**: Efficient list operations and iteration
- **Error Prevention**: Conditional checks for data integrity
- **Code Organization**: Clear, logical algorithm structure

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Python can be used to automate and improve the management of IP access control lists. By developing a robust algorithm for IP list updates, I was able to create a reliable solution that reduces manual errors and ensures consistent data formatting.

The solution successfully addressed the organization's needs for efficient IP list management while maintaining data integrity and proper file handling practices. The modular design also allows for easy expansion to support additional features or more complex access control rules in the future.
